#This website is for bird lovers! It's quick and easy and solved my problem of not wanting to download every dataset on Merlin Bird ID. I found that Cornell's website itself didn't have the greatest way of searching for recently-spotted birds in any region. Please reach out if you'd like to develop this further w/ me or if you have other requests. It uses eBird API and Wikipedia's API.

#The project is run on React and Typescript
To start it up, run 'npm run dev'
